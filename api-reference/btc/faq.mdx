  <Accordion title="How do I support additional wallets?" icon="wallet">
    **Answer:** Currently, BTC Connect is compatible with a select group of wallets, including **UniSat**, **OKX**, **Bitget**, **TokenPocket**, **Bybit**, **Wizz**, and **Xverse**. Unfortunately, adding support for custom wallets isn't available at this time.

  <Accordion title="How do I integrate BTC Connect into my custom connection interface?" icon="bitcoin">
    **Answer:** You can integrate BTC Connect directly into your own connection interface, bypassing the native connection modal. 
    
    To achieve this, use the `connect` method from `useConnector`, passing in a string representing the specific wallet you want to connect with, such as `unisat`. This approach enables you to create custom buttons or UI elements that trigger these connections seamlessly.

    Here is an example of how to implement this:

    ```tsx App.tsx
    import { useConnector } from '@particle-network/btc-connectkit';

    const { connect } = useConnector();
    
        // Handler to initiate login via Unisat
        const handleLogin = () => {
        if (!accounts.length) {
            connect('unisat')
        }
    };
    ```
  </Accordion>
