## Unified interaction mechanism for Web2 and Web3 accounts

Particle Wallet is a **universal infrastructure for facilitating account interaction**, originating from both Web2 (through Particle Auth) and Web3 (external wallets, such as MetaMask). This central wallet interface allows for predictable and **unified utilization of accounts**, plugging in directly to Particle Connect and Particle Auth to create a **cohesive tech stack for social login, external wallet connection, and account utilization**.

Particle Wallet can directly be integrated into existing applications leveraging Particle Auth or Particle Connect to streamline and customize wallet interaction.
