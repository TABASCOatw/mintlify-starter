## SDK Integration
Integrating the on-ramp feature into your platform allows for extensive customization of the buy/sell experience. Below are the parameters you can use to tailor the user experience:

| Name           | Description                                                                 | Type    |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `network`      | Blockchain network to be used (e.g., Solana, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain).| string  |
| `fiatCoin`     | The fiat currency the user wishes to use.                                   | string  |
| `cryptoCoin`   | The cryptocurrency the user wishes to buy or sell.                          | string  |
| `fiatAmt`      | The amount of fiat currency the user wants to spend (for buying crypto).    | number  |
| `cryptAmt`     | The amount of cryptocurrency the user wants to sell.                        | number  |
| `fixFiatCoin`  | Prevent the user from changing the fiat currency.                           | boolean |
| `fixCryptoCoin`| Prevent the user from changing the cryptocurrency.                          | boolean |
| `fixFiatAmt`   | Lock the fiat amount, preventing the user from changing it.                 | boolean |
| `walletAddress`| Wallet address where the purchased cryptocurrency should be sent.           | string  |
| `theme`        | Interface theme: `light` or `dark`.                                         | string  |
| `language`     | Language selection: `en`, `zh-CN`, `zh-TW`, `ja`, `ko`.                     | string  |

## Example usage

To integrate, simply pass the desired options into the SDKs API, or construct a URL with the corresponding parameters.

Below is an example of using the `openBuy` method from the `useAuthCore` hook (from [Particle Auth](/api-reference/auth/desktop-sdks/web)).

```tsx App.tsx
  const { address } = useEthereum();
  const { openBuy } = useAuthCore();

  const handleOpenBuy = () => {
    // Example parameters for the buy page
    const options = {
      fiatCoin: "USD",
      fiatAmt: "29.99",
      cryptoCoin: "ETH",
      network: "Ethereum",
      theme: "dark",
      language: "en",
      walletAddress: address, // You can use any address, or leave blank to allow the user to choose
    };

    openBuy(options);
  };
```

### Build an On-Ramp URL

Alternatively, you can manually build a URL with the desired parameters to redirect users directly to the On-Ramp buy page.

```tsx App.tsx
  // Parameters
  const fiatCoin = 'USD';
  const cryptoCoin = 'ETH';
  const network = 'Ethereum';
  const theme = 'dark';
  const language = 'en';

  // Function to handle the button click
  const handleOnRamp = () => {
    const onRampUrl = `https://ramp.particle.network/?fiatCoin=${fiatCoin}&cryptoCoin=${cryptoCoin}&network=${network}&theme=${theme}&language=${language}`;
    window.open(onRampUrl, '_blank');
  };
```
