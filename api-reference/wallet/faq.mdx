<Accordion title="Why are the transaction records in the wallet incomplete?" icon="list">
  **Answer:** Incomplete transaction records in the wallet may occur due to the large number of supported chains, particularly on testnets where detailed transaction histories are not always available. For mainnets, we strive to ensure comprehensive support. If you notice any gaps in transaction records for a particular chain, please reach out to us, and we will assess the possibility of enhancing support for that chain.
