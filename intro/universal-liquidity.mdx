**Universal Liquidity** is the mechanism that powers [Universal Accounts](/intro/universal-accounts)' cross-chain transactions. It allows for the automatic and atomic routing of liquidity across chains on a per-transaction basis—without the need for users to manually bridge, swap, or move tokens between networks.

This functionality is built into **Particle's Universal SDK**, enabling developers to give users a single, unified balance across all supported chains. The SDK handles everything: sourcing funds, executing cross-chain logic, and coordinating network settlement.

For example, if a user wants to transact with a Universal Account on a chain where they don’t hold funds, **Universal Liquidity** automatically pulls the required tokens from their balances on other chains. The process is invisible to the user, and they can pay gas in **any token**, on any chain.

## How Is This Possible?

Universal Liquidity is made possible through the **Particle Chain**'s Modular Nodes and Decentralized Messaging Network. These, alongside Bundler Nodes, allow Universal Liquidity to automate the execution of operations across chains, enabling a universal balance capable of being consumed on any blockchain.
