**Universal Accounts** give users one account, balance, and interaction point to use across any chainâ€”EVM or not.

Instead of managing different wallets and bridging tokens to interact with dApps on different chains, users interact through a Universal Account as if the entire Web3 ecosystem were one network. This is possible because Particle Network's underlying infrastructure automatically routes liquidity, bridges assets, and manages cross-chain logic using [Universal Liquidity](/intro/universal-liquidity).

Developers can integrate Universal Accounts easily into their dApps using the [Universal SDK](/universal-accounts/ua-reference/overview). UAs are compatible with both social logins and wallet connections and support gasless, cross-chain operations out of the box.

# Understanding Universal Accounts

From a technical standpoint, Universal Accounts are smart contract account deployments unified and coordinated by Particle Network's [Universal Liquidity](/intro/universal-liquidity) technology across chains. This enables seamless cross-chain transactions and interactions.

## Key Features

### Chain abstraction

- One account, one balance, any chain.
- Automatic bridging and cross-chain interactions on a per-transaction basis.
- Ability to use multiple gas tokens for different operations.
- Seamless asset transfers across chains.

### Smart Account implementation

- Built on the ERC-4337 standard.
- Compatible with existing EOA wallets.
- Support social login integration.

## How It Works

1. **Integration**
   - Simple SDK implementation, using any EOA as a signer.
   - Compatible with existing dApp infrastructure.
2. **Account Creation**
   - Universal Accounts are created via logins or wallet connection.
   - They are automatically assigned to a user's EOA.
3. **Cross-Chain Operations**
   - Transactions submitted to the account are funded using a user's collective onchain balance, automatically bridging as needed to fulfill their intent.
   - Gas can be paid using different available tokens.
   - Gasless transactions are available.
