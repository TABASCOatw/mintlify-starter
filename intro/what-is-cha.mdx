**Chain abstraction** is "_a user experience exempt from the manual processes required to interact with multiple chains_".

In other words, it refers to eliminating multi-chain friction from users' experience. Particle Network's approach to enabling chain abstraction is **Universal Accounts**, an account-level solution that gives users a unified account and balance on dApps deployed on any chain.

<Info>
  For developers, Universal Accounts mean that you can build and deploy dApps on one chain, but serve users from all of them—without requiring bridging, chain switching, or holding multiple gas tokens. Instead of forcing users to bridge assets over to the chain(s) your dApp is deployed on, they can instead use a unified**onchain balance**  to transact on your dApp.

## Why Chain Abstraction Matters

Currently, Web3 is highly fragmented:

- Users have to manage **multiple balances or wallets** for different chains.
- Each chain has its own **native gas token** (ETH, SOL, BNB, etc.)
- Bridging assets is **complex, time-consuming, and error-prone**.
- dApp developers must redeploy their apps across multiple chains.

Chain abstraction fixes this by shifting complexity away from users and into infrastructure, so users and developers get a consistent experience across the entire ecosystem.

## Key Properties of Universal Accounts' Chain Abstraction

\*\*1. One Account \*\*\
Users interact with dApps through a **Universal Account**, with a single address and balance across ecosystems.

**2. Unified Liquidity**\
Transactions automatically route liquidity behind the scenes, removing the need for bridges or manual swaps.

**3. Universal Gas**\
Users can pay gas fees with **any token** from **any chain**, abstracting away the need to hold native gas tokens.
