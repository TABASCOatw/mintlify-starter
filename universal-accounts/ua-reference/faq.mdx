<Accordion title="What is the Universal Accounts SDK?" icon="browser">
**Answer:** The Universal Accounts SDK lets you integrate Particle's Chain Abstraction stack into your app. It provides a unified address and balance for users across EVM chains and Solana.

You can use the SDK to:
- Give users a unified assets balance and identity across chains and ecosystems
- Execute transactions across chains without bridging or transferring assets
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Which platforms are supported?" icon="desktop">
**Answer:** The SDK is available for Web.

<Tip>Check out the [SDK Reference](/universal-accounts/ua-reference/desktop/web) for detailed platform-specific docs.</Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are primary assets and how do they work?" icon="coins">
**Answer:** Primary assets are tokens composing the Universal Balance the Universal Accounts SDK uses as sources for transactions. These assets are used for gas, swaps, and liquidity routing—even across chains.

<Note>
  Default primary assets include:
  - **ETH**
  - **USDT**
  - **USDC**
  - **BTC**
  - **SOL**
  - **BNB**
</Note>

Users can hold primary assets on any [supported chain](/universal-accounts/cha/chains). When a transaction (like a swap or transfer) is initiated, the SDK:
- Selects the most optimal primary asset from the user's portfolio (e.g., USDT on Polygon)
- Handles liquidity routing automatically through Universal Liquidity
- Completes the transaction on the target chain (e.g., BNB Chain), even if the user has **no funds** on that chain

This system eliminates the need for manual bridging or gas management, streamlining cross-chain activity.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do users need to deposit assets into their Universal Account?" icon="vault">
**Answer:** Yes. The Universal Account is an ERC-4337 smart account, which means users must deposit assets into it before they can use Universal Liquidity or perform cross-chain transactions.

The account doesn't pull assets from external wallets like MetaMask—it only operates on the assets deposited into the Universal Account itself.

<Note>
If a user already holds funds on [UniversalX](https://universalx.app), those balances are already available and usable through the SDK.
</Note>

To enable swaps, transfers, or contract calls:
- Users must hold **at least one primary asset** (e.g., ETH, USDC, USDT) on their Universal Account.
- Once deposited, the SDK can route liquidity across supported chains.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do Universal Accounts have private keys?" icon="lock-open">
**Answer:** No. Universal Accounts are ERC-4337 smart accounts—they don’t have private keys like traditional EOAs (Externally Owned Accounts).

Instead, ownership and permissions are managed via a signer (such as a user's wallet or social login) that authorizes transactions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What are the transaction fees?" icon="file-invoice-dollar">
**Answer:** Each transaction includes:

- **Standard gas fees** for execution on the destination chain  
- A **20 basis points (0.20%) fee** paid to the LP (liquidity provider) that facilitates the transaction

These fees are automatically calculated and included in the transaction quote returned by the SDK. Users don’t need to manage gas tokens—**Universal Liquidity handles routing and fee payments behind the scenes**.
